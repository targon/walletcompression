FAQ.

Q. Why should I compress my Bitcoin wallet?
A. Your Bitcoin wallet contains individual coins. They can be larger or smaller in
size. If you have too many small coins (e.g. from faucets), the generated transactions
will be larger and consequently require higher transaction fees.

Q. How can this tool help?
A. This tool combines small coins from your wallet into larger coins, thus decreasing 
the need to pey transaction fees.

Q. How do I use it?
A. You need Python and bitcoind installed. Quit your GUI Bitcoin wallet, then start this 
tool on the command line: ./walletcompression.py
It will display the proposed transactions and wait for your confirmation.

Q. Will I need to pay transaction fees for using this tool?
A. No the tool does not include fees in the transaction. It tries to combine coins in such 
a way that the transactions will eventually confirm without a fee.

Q. How fast will my coins be compressed?
A. The tool only needs a second, however it can be quite a while before the generated 
transactions confirm. Potentially this can take a day or longer depending on the age
and coin sizes in your wallet. Before the transactions are sent, the amount of Bitcoins
that will be temporarily unavailable are displayed so you can take an informed decision.

Q. Is it save? Will it send my coins to other people?
A. The tool is open source, so you can (and should) check yourself!
